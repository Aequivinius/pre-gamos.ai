        "Text": "Ivermectin is a widely used drug for the treatment and control of several neglected tropical diseases1 the drug has an excellent safety profile with more than 25 billion doses distributed in the last 30 years and its potential to reduce malaria transmission by killing mosquitoes is under evaluation in several trials around the world2 ivermectin inhibits the in vitro replication of some positive singlestranded rna viruses namely dengue virus dnv35 zika virus46 yellow fever virus78 and others479 caly et al10 recently reported that ivermectin is a potent inhibitor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 replication in vitro given the coronavirus disease19 covid19 pandemic this has understandably resonated widely in the global press11 caly et al10 report a 5000fold reduction in sarscov2 rna levels compared with those in controls after infected verohslam cells were incubated for 48 hours with 5 m ivermectin the ivermectin ic50 for the virus was calculated at approximately 25 m these concentrations are the equivalent of 4370 and 2190 ngml respectively notably 50 to 100fold the peak concentration cmax achieved in plasma after the single dose of 200 gkg 14 mg in a 70kg adult commonly used for the control of onchocerchiasis12 pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers have suggested that single doses up to 120 mg of ivermectin can be safe and well tolerated13 however even with this dose which is 10fold greater than those approved by the us food and drug administration the cmax values reported were 250 ngml13 one order of magnitude lower than effective in vitro concentrations against sarscov2 these findings may seem to discourage followup clinical trials with ivermectin however some in vivo effect may be possible even if efficacious in vitro concentrations are physiologically unattainable a recent phase iii clinical trial in dengue patients in thailand in which a oncedaily dose of 400 gkg for 3 days was found to be safe but did not produce any clinical benefit14 showed a modest and indirect in vivo effect against dnv14 previous work by wagstaff et al5 reported inhibition at much higher in vitro concentrations 25 m in dnvinfected vero cells both pharmacokinetic considerations and the relatively long incubation period of dnv might explain the lack of clinical efficacy until we have a better understanding of ivermectins antiviral mode of action and of appropriate in vitro systems for testing we caution against using findings in vero cells as more than a qualitative indicator of potential efficacy very recently preliminary findings on a potential effect of hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin against sarscov2 were widely publicized15 leading to a surge in demand and selfmedication which resulted in serious harm in some cases and a stock shortage that jeopardized drug availability for other critical conditions for which hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is the standard of care that is vivax malaria rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus efficacy claims for hydroxychloroquine against covid19 have been questioned in followup trials using similar dosing regimens1617 and we await results of randomized controlled clinical trials exploring treatment efficacy we believe the recent findings regarding ivermectin warrant rapidly implemented controlled clinical trials to assess its efficacy against sarscov2 these trials may open a new field of research on the potential use of avermectin antiparasitic drugs including compounds with an improved pharmacokinetic profile as antivirals18 however because of the following points extreme due diligence and regulatory review are needed before testing ivermectin in severe disease first ivermectin which targets glutamategated chlorine channels in invertebrates may crosstarget the gabagated chlorine channels present in the mammalian central nervous system cns and cause neurotoxicity19 this is normally prevented by an intact bloodbrain barrier bbb but in patients with a hyperinflammatory state endothelial permeability at the bbb may be increased and cause leaking of drugs into the cns potentially causing harm2021 second boosted antiretrovirals such as lopinavirritonavir and darunavircobicistat which have been widely used against sarscov2 based on limited evidence and a number of other drugs are potent inhibitors of cytochrome p450 3a4 the main metabolic pathway for ivermectin concurrent use of these drugs will result in increased systemic exposure to ivermectin furthermore ritonavir and cobicistat can readily inhibit one of the main efflux pumps in the bbb pglycoprotein further favoring neurotoxicity2223 however it is encouraging that a recent analysis of ivermectinrelated neurotoxic adverse events reported to the who program for international drug monitoring found only one case of 1668 reports in which concomitant use of antivirals was associated with neurotoxicity24 third as earlier available evidence suggests that levels of ivermectin with meaningful activity against sarscov2 would not be achieved without extraordinary potentially toxic increases in ivermectin dosing levels in humans however evidence from animal models showing up to 3fold higher levels in pulmonary tissue than in plasma 1 week after oral dosing leaves the door open for further research in particular for the treatment of respiratory viruses2526 the discovery of ivermectins activity against sarscov2 gives reason for hope but offlabel and compassionate use requires careful riskbenefit considerations27 especially in critically ill patients a path to consider is evaluation first of impacts on virologic outcomes in uncomplicated lowrisk patients early in the course of the disease wellconducted clinical trials informed by robust pharmacokinetic models should be considered to validate the impact before the use of ivermectin to treat sarscov2 is implemented"

All included patients completed their hospital course (discharged or died) by april 21, 2020. Patients who were hospitalised during the study period without a completed course were unable to be analysed. The study cohort included 63 315 (659%) patients from north america, 16 574 (173%) from europe, 8101 (84%) from asia, 4402 (46%) from africa, 3577 (37%) from south america, and 63 (01%) from australia (details of the number of hospitals per continent are presented in the appendix, p 3). The mean age was 538 years (sd 176), 44 426 (463%) were women, mean bmi was 276 kg/m2 (sd 55; 29 510 [307%] were obese with bmi 30 kg/m2), 64 220 (669%) were white, 9054 (94%) were black, 5978 (62%) were hispanic, and 13 519 (141%) were of asian origin (appendix p 4). In terms of comorbidities, 30 198 (314%) had hyperlipidaemia, 25 810 (269%) had hypertension, 13 260 (138%) had diabetes, 3177 (33%) had copd, 2868 (30%) had an underlying immunosuppressed condition, 16 553 (172%) were former smokers, and 9488 (99%) were current smokers. In terms of pre-existing cardiovascular disease, 12 137 (126%) had coronary artery disease, 2368 (25%) had a history of congestive heart failure, and 3381 (35%) had a history of arrhythmia. The mean length of stay in hospital was 91 days (sd 64), with an overall in-hospital mortality of 10 698 (111%) of 96 032. The use of other antivirals was recorded in 38 927 (405%) patients as treatment for covid-19. The most common antivirals were lopinavir with ritonavir (12 304 [316%]), ribavirin (7904 [203%]), and oseltamivir (5101 [131%]). Combination therapy with more than one of these antiviral regimens was used for 6782 (174%) patients. The treatment groups included 1868 patients who were given chloroquine alone, 3016 given hydroxychloroquine alone, 3783 given chloroquine with a macrolide and 6221 given hydroxychloroquine and a macrolide. The median time from hospitalisation to diagnosis of covid-19 was 2 days (iqr 14). The mean daily dose and duration of the various drug regimens were as follows: chloroquine alone, 765 mg (sd 308) and 66 days (24); hydroxychloroquine alone, 596 mg (126) and 42 days (19); chloroquine with a macrolide, 790 mg (320) and 68 days (25); and hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, 597 mg (128) and 43 days (20). Additional details of the study cohort are provided in the appendix (pp 45). Demographic variables and comorbidities were compared among survivors and non-survivors (table 1). Non-survivors were older, more likely to be obese, more likely to be men, more likely to be black or hispanic, and to have diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and a history of arrhythmias. Non-survivors were also more likely to have copd and to have reported current smoking. The distribution of demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes between the four treatment groups are shown in table 2. No significant between-group differences were found among baseline characteristics or comorbidities. Ventricular arrhythmias were more common in the treatment groups compared with the control population. Mortality was higher in the treatment groups compared with the control population (p<00001; appendix pp 1518). Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality are shown in figure 2. Age, bmi, black race or hispanic ethnicity (versus white race), coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, history of arrhythmia, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, copd, being a current smoker, and immunosuppressed condition were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death. Female sex, ethnicity of asian origin, use of ace inhibitors (but not angiotensin receptor blockers), and use of statins was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality risk. Compared with the control group (93%), hydroxychloroquine alone (180%; hr 1335, 95% ci 12231457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (238%; 1447, 13681531), chloroquine alone (164%; 1365, 12181531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (222%; 1368, 12731469) were independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. The multivariable cox regression analyses by continent are shown in the appendix (pp 611), as well as data from the sex-adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses (pp 1213) and a separate cox regression analysis for the combined endpoint of mechanical ventilation or mortality (p 14).

Bmi=body mass index. Copd=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Hr=hazard ratio. Qsofa=quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment. Spo2=oxygen saturation. Independent predictors of ventricular arrythmia are shown in figure 3. Coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrhythmia, and copd were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias during hospitalisation. Compared with the control group (03%), hydroxychloroquine alone (61%; hr 2369, 95% ci 19352900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (81%; 5106, 41065983), chloroquine alone (43%; 3561, 27604596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (65%; 4011, 33444812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation. Age and bmi are continuous variables. The 95% cis have not been adjusted for multiple testing and should not be used to infer definitive effects. Ace=angiotensin-converting enzyme. Bmi=body mass index. Copd=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Hr=hazard ratio. Qsofa=quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment. Spo2=oxygen saturation. Analyses using propensity score matching by treatment group are shown in the appendix (pp 1518). The results indicated that the associations between the drug regimens and mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias were consistent with the primary analysis. A tipping point analysis was done to assess the effects of an unmeasured confounder on the findings of significance with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (appendix pp 1920). For chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine with a macrolide, a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 50% in the exposed population would need to have an hr of 15 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5% level. For a comparison with the observed confounders in this study, if congestive heart failure (which has an hr of 1756) were left out of the model, it would need to have a prevalence of approximately 30% in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis. Similarly, for hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 37% in the exposed population would need to have an hr of 20 to tip this analysis to non-significance at the 5% level. Again, congestive heart failure (which has an hr of 1756) would need to have a prevalence of approximately 50% in the population to lead to confounding in the analysis, had it not been adjusted for in the cox proportional hazards model."

        "Text": "Abstract background hydroxychloroquine has been widely administered to patients with covid-19 without robust evidence supporting its use. Methods we examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in new york city. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with covid-19, excluding those who were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department (study baseline). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Results of 1446 consecutive patients, 70 patients were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1376 patients, during a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days); 45.8% of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department, and 85.9% within 48 hours. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360). Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation). In the main analysis, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.32). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions in this observational study involving patients with covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death. Randomized, controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid-19 are needed. (funded by the national institutes of health. ) the aminoquinolines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are widely used in the treatment of malaria and rheumatic diseases, and they have been suggested as effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) on the grounds of both antiinflammatory and antiviral effects.1-4 in the united states, the food and drug administration issued an emergency use authorization on march 30, 2020, that allowed the use of these drugs in patients with covid-19 who were not enrolled in clinical trials. Guidelines suggested that these drugs be administered to hospitalized patients who had evidence of pneumonia,5 and to date, they have been used in many thousands of patients with acute covid-19 around the world. However, to date, there have been no robust clinical trials that have shown efficacy of these agents for this illness, and the data that are available come from small studies that have either been uncontrolled or underpowered to detect meaningful clinical effects. The original report of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for covid-19 described 26 patients who had been treated in an open-label, single-group study that involved contemporaneous, but nonrandomized controls in hospitals in france.6 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 200 mg three times daily for 10 days. Data from this study were reported as showing the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in reducing the viral burden in treated patients (65.0% clearance by day 5, vs. 18.8% clearance by day 5 in untreated patients). However, data from 6 patients who received hydroxychloroquine were excluded from the analysis because of clinical worsening or loss to follow-up, which makes it difficult to interpret the findings. Recent work suggests that hydroxychloroquine has more potent antiviral properties than chloroquine, as well as a better safety profile.7 in accordance with clinical guidelines developed at our medical center, hydroxychloroquine was suggested as treatment for hospitalized patients with covid-19 and respiratory difficulty, as indicated by a low resting oxygen saturation, during the period in which patients in this report were admitted. We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and respiratory failure at a large medical center providing care to a substantial number of patients with covid-19 in new york city. We hypothesized that hydroxychloroquine use would be associated with a lower risk of a composite end point of intubation or death in analyses that were adjusted for major predictors of respiratory failure and weighted according to propensity scores assessing the probability of hydroxychloroquine use. Methods setting we conducted this study at new yorkpresbyterian hospital (nyp)columbia university irving medical center (cuimc), a quaternary, acute care hospital in northern manhattan. We obtained samples from all admitted adults who had a positive test result for the virus sars-cov-2 from analysis of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens obtained at any point during their hospitalization from march 7 to april 8, 2020. Follow-up continued through april 25, 2020. These tests were conducted by the new york state department of health until the nypcuimc laboratory developed internal testing capability with a reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction assay on march 11, 2020. Patients who were intubated, who died, or who were transferred to another facility within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department were excluded from the analysis. The institutional review board at cuimc approved this analysis under an expedited review. A guidance developed by the department of medicine and distributed to all the house staff and attending staff at our medical center suggested hydroxychloroquine as a therapeutic option for patients with covid-19 who presented with moderate-to-severe respiratory illness, which was defined as a resting oxygen saturation of less than 94% while they were breathing ambient air. The suggested hydroxychloroquine regimen was a loading dose of 600 mg twice on day 1, followed by 400 mg daily for 4 additional days. Azithromycin at a dose of 500 mg on day 1 and then 250 mg daily for 4 more days in combination with hydroxychloroquine was an additional suggested therapeutic option. The azithromycin suggestion was removed on april 12, 2020, and the hydroxychloroquine suggestion was removed on april 29, 2020. The decision to prescribe either or both medications was left to the discretion of the treating team for each individual patient. Patients receiving sarilumab were allowed to continue hydroxychloroquine. Patients receiving remdesivir as part of a randomized trial either did not receive or had completed a course of treatment with hydroxychloroquine. Data sources we obtained data from the nypcuimc clinical data warehouse. This warehouse contains all the clinical data available on all inpatient and outpatient visits to one of the cuimc facilities (see the data extraction section in the supplementary appendix, available with the full text of this article at nejm. Org). No data were manually abstracted from the electronic medical record or charts. The data obtained included patients demographic details, insurance status, vital signs, laboratory test results, medication administration data, historical and current medication lists, historical and current diagnoses, clinical notes, historical discharge disposition for previous inpatient hospitalizations, and ventilator use data. Variables assessed from the clinical data warehouse, we obtained the following data elements for each patient: age; sex; patient-reported race and ethnic group; current insurance carrier; the first recorded vital signs on presentation; the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (pao2: fio2) at admission, estimated with the use of methods developed by brown and colleagues8,9 (see the data extraction section in the supplementary appendix); the first recorded body-mass index as calculated for measured height and weight (the body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters), grouped on the basis of the centers for disease control and prevention guidelines for adults; the first recorded inpatient laboratory tests; past and current diagnoses; patient-reported smoking status; and medication administration at baseline. Details of the variables assessed are provided in the supplementary appendix. Hydroxychloroquine exposure patients were defined as receiving hydroxychloroquine if they were receiving it at study baseline or received it during the follow-up period before intubation or death. Study baseline was defined as 24 hours after arrival at the emergency department. End point the primary end point was the time from study baseline to intubation or death. For patients who died after intubation, the timing of the primary end point was defined as the time of intubation. Statistical analysis we calculated bivariate frequencies to examine the associations among the preadmission variables described above. Patients without a primary end-point event had their data censored on april 25, 2020. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to estimate the association between hydroxychloroquine use and the composite end point of intubation or death. An initial multivariable cox regression model included demographic factors, clinical factors, laboratory tests, and medications. In addition, to help account for the nonrandomized treatment administration of hydroxychloroquine, we used propensity-score methods to reduce the effects of confounding. The individual propensities for receipt of hydroxychloroquine treatment were estimated with the use of a multivariable logistic-regression model that included the same covariates as the cox regression model. Associations between hydroxychloroquine use and respiratory failure were then estimated by multivariable cox regression models with the use of three propensity-score methods. The primary analysis used inverse probability weighting. In the inverse-probability-weighted analysis, the predicted probabilities from the propensity-score model were used to calculate the stabilized inverse-probability-weighting weight.10 kaplanmeier curves and cox models that used the inverse-probability-weighting weights were reported. We conducted a secondary analysis that used propensity-score matching and another that included the propensity score as an additional covariate. In the propensity-score matching analysis, the nearest-neighbor method was applied to create a matched control sample. Additional sensitivity analyses included the same set of analyses with the use of a different study baseline of 48 hours after arrival to the emergency department as well as analyses that defined the exposure as receipt of the first dose of hydroxychloroquine before study baseline only. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data, and model estimates and standard errors were calculated with rubins rules.11 the nonparametric bootstrap method was used to obtain 95% pointwise confidence intervals for the inverse-probability-weighted kaplanmeier curves. The statistical analyses were performed with the use of r software, version 3.6.1 (r project for statistical computing). Results characteristics of the cohort figure 1. Study cohort. Of 1446 consecutive patients with covid-19 who were admitted to the hospital between march 7 and april 8, 2020, a total of 70 patients were excluded from this study because they had already had intubation or death, were discharged after inpatient admission, or were directly admitted to alternative facilities within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department. Thus, 1376 patients were included in the analysis (figure 1). Over a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (166 patients died without being intubated, and 180 were intubated). At the time of data cutoff on april 25, a total of 232 patients had died (66 after intubation), 1025 had survived to hospital discharge, and 119 were still hospitalized (only 24 of whom were not intubated) (table s1 in the supplementary appendix). Table 1. Characteristics of patients receiving or not receiving hydroxychloroquine, before and after propensity-score matching. Of the 1376 patients, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (median duration of treatment, 5 days) and 565 (41.1%) did not. Among the patients who received hydroxychloroquine, 45.8% received it in the 24 hours between their presentation to the emergency department and the start of study follow-up, and 85.9% received it within 48 hours after presentation to the emergency department. The timing of the first dose of hydroxychloroquine after presentation to the medical center is shown in figure s3. The distribution of the patients baseline characteristics according to hydroxychloroquine exposure is shown in table 1, both in the unmatched and propensity-scorematched analytic samples. In the unmatched sample, hydroxychloroquine exposure differed according to age group, sex, race and ethnic group, body-mass index, insurance, smoking status, and current use of other medications. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients had a lower pao2: fio2 at baseline than did patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median, 233 vs. 360 mm hg). In addition to the 27 patients listed in table 1 who received remdesivir according to compassionate use, 30 patients in the study cohort were enrolled in randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trials of that investigational agent or of sarilumab. Table 2. Associations between hydroxychloroquine use and the composite end point of intubation or death in the crude analysis, multivariable analysis, and propensity-score analyses. The distribution of the estimated propensity scores for receipt of hydroxychloroquine among patients who did and did not receive hydroxychloroquine is shown in figure s1. The odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for receipt of hydroxychloroquine according to all the variables included in the propensity-score model are shown in table s2. The c-statistic of the propensity-score model was 0.81. In the matched analytic sample, 811 patients were exposed to hydroxychloroquine and 274 were not exposed. The differences between hydroxychloroquine and pretreatment variables were attenuated in the propensity-scorematched samples as compared with the unmatched samples (table 2 and fig. S2). Study end points figure 2. Freedom from composite end point of intubation or death. Among the 1376 patients included in the analysis, the primary end point of respiratory failure developed in 346 patients (25.1%); a total of 180 patients were intubated, and 166 died without intubation. In the crude, unadjusted analysis, patients who had received hydroxychloroquine were more likely to have had a primary end-point event than were patients who did not (hazard ratio, 2.37; 95% ci, 1.84 to 3.02) (table 2). In the primary multivariable analysis with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and the composite primary end point (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% ci, 0.82 to 1.32) (figure 2). There was also no significant association between treatment with azithromycin and the composite end point (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% ci, 0.81 to 1.31). Additional multivariable propensity-score analyses yielded similar results (table 2). Multiple additional sensitivity analyses, including analyses that used a different baseline at 48 hours after presentation and analyses with treatment defined as receipt of the first dose of hydroxychloroquine before study baseline, showed similar results (table s3). Discussion in this analysis involving a large sample of consecutive patients who had been hospitalized with covid-19, the risk of intubation or death was not significantly higher or lower among patients who received hydroxychloroquine than among those who did not (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% ci, 0.82 to 1.32). Given the observational design and the relatively wide confidence interval, the study should not be taken to rule out either benefit or harm of hydroxychloroquine treatment. However, our findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine at present, outside randomized clinical trials testing its efficacy. As we noted in the introduction, the findings from an early study showing a benefit of hydroxychloroquine in 26 patients who had been treated in french hospitals are difficult to interpret, given the small size of that study, the lack of a randomized control group, and the omission of 6 patients from the analysis.6 a clinical trial testing two doses of chloroquine in patients with covid-19 planned to include 440 patients but was halted after 81 patients had been enrolled because of excessive qtc prolongation and an indication of higher mortality in the high-dose group (in which patients received 600 mg twice daily for 10 days) than in the low-dose group (in which patients received 450 mg daily for 4 days after an initial dose of 450 mg administered twice on the first day).12 two small, randomized trials from china have been reported. Physicians in wuhan randomly assigned 62 patients with mild illness to either the control group (in which patients could receive supplemental oxygen, unspecified antiviral agents, antibiotic agents, and immune globulin, with or without glucocorticoids) or the experimental group (in which patients also received 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily). This report has not yet been fully peer-reviewed, but results were posted to the medrxiv website for public comment.13 investigators reported a faster mean time to clinical recovery (resolution of fever and cough and improvement on chest radiography) in the experimental group than in the control group. Four patients (all in the control group) had progression to severe infection. A small, randomized trial involving 30 patients in shanghai reported on outcomes in patients treated with 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily for 5 days, as compared with a control group in which patients received conventional treatment only.14 this trial showed that by day 7, a total of 86% of the patients in the hydroxychloroquine-treated group and 93% of those in the control group had negative results on viral throat swabs. All the patients in this trial also received aerosolized interferon alfa by nebulizer. A randomized clinical trial is the best approach to determine whether benefit can be ascribed to any given therapeutic intervention because this trial design minimizes the two major problems inherent in observational studies: unmeasured confounding and bias. With the analytic approaches we used in this examination of our observational cohort, we have tried to minimize possible confounding in a variety of ways. In the main analysis, a multivariable regression model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and the risk of intubation or death. We also performed a series of analyses using several propensity-score approaches. Findings were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. The consistency of the results across these analyses is reassuring. In our analysis, we adjusted for likely confounders, including age, race and ethnic group, body-mass index, diabetes, underlying kidney disease, chronic lung disease, hypertension, baseline vital signs, pao2: fio2, and inflammatory markers of the severity of illness. Despite this extensive adjustment, it is still possible that some amount of unmeasured confounding remains. Additional limitations of our study include missing data for some variables and potential for inaccuracies in the electronic health records, such as lack of documentation of smoking and coexisting illness for some patients. Nonetheless, we used contemporary methods to deal with missing data to minimize bias. Finally, the single-center design may limit the generalizability of these results. Clinical guidance at our medical center has been updated to remove the suggestion that patients with covid-19 be treated with hydroxychloroquine. In our analysis involving a large sample of consecutive patients who had been hospitalized with covid-19, hydroxychloroquine use was not associated with a significantly higher or lower risk of intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% ci, 0.82 to 1.32). The study results should not be taken to rule out either benefit or harm of hydroxychloroquine treatment, given the observational design and the 95% confidence interval, but the results do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine at present, outside randomized clinical trials testing its efficacy."

        "Text": "Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the virus that caused coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), the use of face masks has become ubiquitous in china and other asian countries such as south korea and japan. Some provinces and municipalities in china have enforced compulsory face mask policies in public areas; however, china's national guideline has adopted a risk-based approach in offering recommendations for using face masks among health-care workers and the general public. We compared face mask use recommendations by different health authorities (panel). Despite the consistency in the recommendation that symptomatic individuals and those in health-care settings should use face masks, discrepancies were observed in the general public and community settings.1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 for example, the us surgeon general advised against buying masks for use by healthy people. One important reason to discourage widespread use of face masks is to preserve limited supplies for professional use in health-care settings. Universal face mask use in the community has also been discouraged with the argument that face masks provide no effective protection against coronavirus infection. Panel recommendations on face mask use in community settings who1  if you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected sars-cov-2 infection.  View related content for this article china2  people at moderate risk * of infection: surgical or disposable mask for medical use. *people at moderate risk of infection include those working in areas of high population density (eg, hospitals, train stations), those have been or live with somebody who is quarantined, and administrative staff, police, security, and couriers whose work is related to covid-19.  People at low risk  of infection: disposable mask for medical use. People at low risk of infection include those staying in areas of high population density (eg, supermarket, shopping mall), who work indoors, who seek health care in medical institutions (other than fever clinics), and gatherings of children aged 36 years and school students.  People at very low risk  of infection: do not have to wear a mask or can wear non-medical mask (such as cloth mask). People at very low risk of infection include those who mostly stay at home, who do outdoor activities, and who work or study in well-ventilated areas. Hong kong3  surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from people who are ill. It is essential for people who are symptomatic (even if they have mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask.  Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly and practice good hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask. Singapore4  wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose. Japan5  the effectiveness of wearing a face mask to protect yourself from contracting viruses is thought to be limited. If you wear a face mask in confined, badly ventilated spaces, it might help avoid catching droplets emitted from others but if you are in an open-air environment, the use of face mask is not very efficient. Usa6  centers for disease control and prevention does not recommend that people who are well wear a face mask (including respirators) to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including covid-19.  Us surgeon general urged people on twitter to stop buying face masks. Uk7  face masks play a very important role in places such as hospitals, but there is very little evidence of widespread benefit for members of the public. Germany8  there is not enough evidence to prove that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduces a healthy person's risk of becoming infected while wearing it. According to who, wearing a mask in situations where it is not recommended to do so can create a false sense of security because it might lead to neglecting fundamental hygiene measures, such as proper hand hygiene. However, there is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence. Evidence that face masks can provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce, as acknowledged in recommendations from the uk and germany.7 , 8 however, face masks are widely used by medical workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections. It would be reasonable to suggest vulnerable individuals avoid crowded areas and use surgical face masks rationally when exposed to high-risk areas. As evidence suggests covid-19 could be transmitted before symptom onset, community transmission might be reduced if everyone, including people who have been infected but are asymptomatic and contagious, wear face masks. Recommendations on face masks vary across countries and we have seen that the use of masks increases substantially once local epidemics begin, including the use of n95 respirators (without any other protective equipment) in community settings. This increase in use of face masks by the general public exacerbates the global supply shortage of face masks, with prices soaring,9 and risks supply constraints to frontline health-care professionals. As a response, a few countries (eg, germany and south korea) banned exportation of face masks to prioritise local demand.10 who called for a 40% increase in the production of protective equipment, including face masks.9 meanwhile, health authorities should optimise face mask distribution to prioritise the needs of frontline health-care workers and the most vulnerable populations in communities who are more susceptible to infection and mortality if infected, including older adults (particularly those older than 65 years) and people with underlying health conditions. People in some regions (eg, thailand, china, and japan) opted for makeshift alternatives or repeated usage of disposable surgical masks. Notably, improper use of face masks, such as not changing disposable masks, could jeopardise the protective effect and even increase the risk of infection. Consideration should also be given to variations in societal and cultural paradigms of mask usage. The contrast between face mask use as hygienic practice (ie, in many asian countries) or as something only people who are unwell do (ie, in european and north american countries) has induced stigmatisation and racial aggravations, for which further public education is needed. One advantage of universal use of face masks is that it prevents discrimination of individuals who wear masks when unwell because everybody is wearing a mask. It is time for governments and public health agencies to make rational recommendations on appropriate face mask use to complement their recommendations on other preventive measures, such as hand hygiene. Who currently recommends that people should wear face masks if they have respiratory symptoms or if they are caring for somebody with symptoms. Perhaps it would also be rational to recommend that people in quarantine wear face masks if they need to leave home for any reason, to prevent potential asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission. In addition, vulnerable populations, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions, should wear face masks if available. Universal use of face masks could be considered if supplies permit. In parallel, urgent research on the duration of protection of face masks, the measures to prolong life of disposable masks, and the invention on reusable masks should be encouraged. Taiwan had the foresight to create a large stockpile of face masks; other countries or regions might now consider this as part of future pandemic plans."

        "Text": "Abstract the science around the use of masks by the public to impede covid-19 transmission is advancing rapidly. In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact, transmission characteristics, source control, wearer protection, sociological considerations, and implementation considerations. A primary route of transmission of covid-19 is via respiratory particles, and it is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: limiting contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures and reducing the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. Given the current shortages of medical masks, we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Because many respiratory particles become smaller due to evaporation, we recommend increasing focus on a previously overlooked aspect of mask usage: mask wearing by infectious people (source control) with benefits at the population level, rather than only mask wearing by susceptible people, such as health care workers, with focus on individual outcomes. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation."

        "Text": "Quality appraisal the quality of the studies was not very homogeneous. The quality assessment identified some studies with low and average quality, which were excluded from the meta-analysis. We included only high-quality studies in our meta-analysis of rcts and nrcts. The quality of the included observational studies is predominantly good. Tables 2ad summarizes the results of the quality appraisal of the included research papers. Mask type of the 37 meta-analytically evaluated studies, 31 examined the n95 mask, 19 the surgical mask with one not reporting on the specific type of mask due to the predominantly psychological research topic. There were 14 studies evaluating both mask types (surgical and n95) and we compared the results in a separate meta- analysis (see below, meta-analysis of n95 mask vs. Surgical mask). Participants and time in order to conduct the meta-analysis 8,641 subjects were included, totaling 22,127 individual measurements/surveys. This population consisted of young (age = 34.8 12.5) and predominantly female subjects (m = 2,482, f = 6,159). Physiological, physical, and biochemical data was used in the meta-analyses comprising of 934 participants and 3,765 experimental measurements. The pooled prevalence data was drawn from a study population of n = 8,128 and included 17,383 data entries. Most of the 37 studies, evaluated in meta-analyses included healthy participants. Twelve studies were conducted in health care workers (32%). Two studies (5%) included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), one study on hemodialysis patients, another study included children (3%) and four studies involved pregnant women (11%). The median experimental time of the studies included in the meta-analyses (mostly controlled trials) on physiological, physical, and chemical face mask effects was 18 min with an interquartile range (iqr) of 50 min (min. : 6 min, max. : 360 min). There was a major variation in mask wearing durations with several outliers leading to a large standard deviation (mean of 45.8 min with a standard deviation of 69.9 min). Therefore, the mean was not an appropriate parameter to characterize this distribution). The study with the longest experimental duration (360 min, observational) included only 21 healthy participants, which corresponds to 2.2% of the total population studied (n = 934). Interestingly, the studies on symptoms (including many observational studies) had significantly longer observation times and a mean of 263.8 170.3 min (median 240, iqr 180) in a total of n = 8,128 participants. Qualitative evaluation of the 54 included studies, 51 reported numerous adverse mask effects across multiple clinical disciplines, as already compiled in a previous scoping review (14). Also 14 of the 17 studies, which were not included in the meta-analysis reported those numerous mask effects. Overall, our systematic review found mask related symptoms that can be classified under the previously described mask-induced exhaustion syndrome (mies) (14), with typical changes and symptoms that are often observed in combination. Among the included 54 studies (table 1), we detected and compiled reports on frequently statistically significant physiological and psychological changes (p < 0.05) belonging to the mies such as: - increase in breathing dead space volume (60, 65). - increase in breathing resistance (53, 59, 66, 67, 83). - increase in blood carbon dioxide (26, 5158, 60, 62, 63, 65, 68, 71, 81, 87, 91, 94). - decrease in blood oxygen saturation (26, 5254, 5760, 62, 67, 71, 72, 79, 81, 91, 94, 100, 101). - increase in heart rate (26, 52, 56, 57, 60, 61, 67, 68, 72, 81, 83, 94, 100, 101). - decrease in cardiopulmonary capacity (53, 59, 62). - changes in respiratory rate (5254, 56, 59, 60, 62, 68, 79, 81, 100). - shortness of breath and difficulty breathing (47, 5254, 58, 68, 69, 73, 79, 81, 83, 86, 87, 92, 94). - headache (54, 63, 73, 78, 82, 84, 89, 9295). - dizziness (54, 79, 81). - feeling hot and clammy (52, 53, 58, 60, 68, 69, 83, 86). - decreased ability to concentrate (101). - decreased ability to think (81, 94, 95, 101). - drowsiness (95). - impaired skin barrier function (47, 74, 95). - itching (47, 52, 53, 74, 80, 82, 83, 86, 97, 98). - acne, skin lesions and irritation (47, 68, 74, 81, 82, 86, 95, 98). - false sense of security (85, 96). - overall perceived fatigue and exhaustion (5254, 5762, 68, 70, 71, 73, 79, 83, 94). Moreover, we could objectify additional symptoms of the mies as follows: - decrease in ventilation (53, 59, 62). - increase in blood pressure (26, 52, 53, 59, 62, 81, 83, 87, 100). - increase of measured temperature of the skin under the mask (58, 68, 69, 90). - increase of measured humidity of the air under the mask (58, 69, 90). - communication disturbance (86, 88, 94, 95, 99). - voice disorder (76, 86). - perceived discomfort (47, 52, 53, 69). - increased anxiety (75, 88, 92). - increased mood swings or depressive mood (75, 76, 88, 92). And: - changes in microbial metabolism (lower gut and oral) (26, 77). However, three studies (6% of the included papers) describe the absence of adverse or even positive mask effects (50, 64, 96). Results of the meta-analysis in the meta-analytic evaluation, we found biochemical, physiological, physical, and perceptual symptoms with face mask use. We were also able to meta-analyze the pooled prevalence of symptoms. These results are presented in detail below. Meta-analysis of biochemical effects of face masks spo2 and face masks the results are summarized in figure 2a. In a pooled analysis, blood oxygen saturation resulted significantly lowered during mask use. This could be found for general mask use (p = 0.0004, smd = 0.24, 95% ci 0.38 to 0.11, z = 3.53, i2 = 0%). The eggers test did not indicate the presence of funnel plot asymmetry [t(df=11) = 0.70, p = 0.50]. This was also confirmed in the subgroup analysis for n95 mask use (p = 0.001, smd = 0.3, 95% ci 0.49 to 0.12, z = 3.19, i2 = 0%), but not for surgical mask use [p = 0.08, smd = 0.17, 95% ci (0.37; 0.02), z = 1.77, i2 = 0%]. However, seven of nine studies in the n95 mask meta-analysis were presumably because of the limited sample size. From the pooled analysis, it seems that n95 mask use may be responsible for a larger spo2 drop than surgical masks. In a separate meta-analysis of pre-post studies an equally significant drop in spo2 was found when using a mask (p = 0.0001, smd = 1.24, 95% ci 1.87 to 0.61, z = 3.87, i2 = 80%) and especially in the subgroup of n95 masks (p = 0.02, smd = 1.24, 95% ci 2.26 to 0.22, z = 2.37, i2 = 89%), yet with a high heterogeneity. Blood co2 content and face masks the results are summarized in figure 2b. In a pooled analysis, blood carbon dioxide content was found to be significantly elevated in mask use. This was found for general mask use (p = 0.0001, smd = 0.64, 95% ci 0.31 to 0.96, z = 3.86, i2 = 81%). The eggers test did not indicate the presence of funnel plot asymmetry [t(df=11) = 0.87, p = 0.40]. This was also confirmed for n95 mask use (p = 0.003, smd = 0.78, 95% ci 0.28 to 1.29, z = 3.02, i2 = 84%) and also for surgical mask use (p < 0.001, smd = 0.42, 95% ci 0.24 to 0.59, z = 4.65, i2 = 0%). There was no significant difference between the pooled effect sizes of n95 and surgical masks [q(df=1) = 3.09, p = 0.08]. Further separate pooled evaluations were also carried out for ptco2, etco2, and paco2, for each surgical and n95 masks with a significant increase in blood co2 with predominantly low heterogeneity. Even in a separate meta-analysis of pre-post studies with high heterogeneity, a significant increase in blood carbon dioxide content was found when using a mask (p = 0.003, smd = 1.44, 95% ci 0.49 to 2.39, z = 2.97, i2 = 94%) and also in the subgroup of n95 masks (p = 0.02, smd = 1.51, 95% ci 0.24 to 2.78, z = 2.34, i2 = 96%). Interestingly, 11 of 17 showed no statistically significant effect. The studies that showed statistically significant effects differed from those that showed no certain effects as they either included n95 and/or pregnant women or children. The study by dirol et al. (52) is an exception but has a sample size of n = 100 for surgical masks. Apparently, it takes n95 masks and vulnerable populations or appropriately large samples in surgical masks to make the effects more quantifiable. Predictably, in the surgical mask meta-analysis, studies with non-significant results were of small sample size, with a mean of n = 24 and a median of n = 14. The advantage of a meta-analysis is to combine several imprecise effects into a more precise overall effect (36). Meta-analysis of physiological effects of face masks ventilation (ve) in l/min and face masks the results are summarized in figure 3a. Despite compensatory mechanisms, breathing volume (l/min) was significantly lowered during mask use in the pooled analysis. This was not only verified for general mask use (p < 0.001, smd = 0.72, z = 5.36, 95% ci 0.99 to 0.46, i2 = 0%) in studies evaluated with an overall low heterogeneity (i2 = 0), but also for surgical (p < 0.001, smd = 0,54, 95% ci 0.94 to 0.35, z = 4.32, i2 = 0%) and n95 mask use (p = 0.0007, smd = 1.06, 95% ci 1.68 to 0.45, z = 3.39, i2 = 0%). Both studies had an overall low heterogeneity (i2 = 0). On average, masks reduced respiratory minute volume by 19% according to our meta-analysis, and by as much as 24% for n95 masks; the difference between surgical and n95 masks was 10% respiratory minute volume. Respiratory rate and face masks the results are summarized in figure 3b. Interestingly, no statistical difference regarding respiratory rate was found in mask use in the pooled analysis. Even in the subgroups containing n95 and surgical masks, no difference compared to the no mask condition could be found systolic blood pressure and masks the results are summarized in figure 4a. A significant elevation in systolic blood pressure was found for mask users with p = 0.02, smd = 0.17, 95% ci 0.03 to 0.32, z = 2.39 and i2 = 0% in the pooled analysis. It was a small effect and in nine out of 10 studies insignificant, including two with higher n in each case. The eggers test does not indicate the presence of funnel plot asymmetry [t(df=8), p = 0.27]. This was verified in the subgroup analysis for surgical masks (p = 0.02, smd = 0.21, 95% ci 0.03 to 0.39, z = 2.33, i2 = 0%). In studies evaluating both mask types (surgical and n95) the n95 mask always yielded a higher sbp than the surgical mask. However, this effect was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference between the pooled effect sizes of n95 and surgical masks [q(df=1) = 0.98, p = 0.32]. Heart rate and masks the results are summarized in figure 4b. No statistically significant difference regarding the heart rate during mask use was found in the pooled analysis. The eggers test did not indicate the presence of funnel plot asymmetry [t(df=14), p = 0.94]. However, in the subgroup analysis containing surgical and n95 masks, only for the n95 mask condition a weak significance for a slight increase in heart rate could be found (p = 0.02, smd = 0.22, 95% ci 0.03 to 0.41, z = 2.30 and low heterogeneity of studies with i2 = 0). There was no significant difference between the pooled effect sizes of n95 and surgical masks [q(df=1) = 1.26, p = 0.26]. Meta-analysis of physical effects of face masks skin temperature and face masks the results are summarized in figure 5a. Skin covered by mask had a significantly higher temperature during rest and activity. This could be found for general mask use (p = 0.005, smd = 0.80, 95% ci 0.23 to 1.38, z = 2.81. I2 = 72%), for n95 mask use (p = 0.02, smd = 0.72, 95% ci 0.12 to 1.32, z = 2.35, i2 = 55%), but not for surgical mask use (p = 0.21, smd = 0.96, z = 1.26, i2 = 90%). Humidity and face masks the results are summarized in figure 5b. The dead space covered by mask had a significantly higher humidity in the pooled analysis. This could be found for general mask use with p < 0.001, smd = 2.24, 95% ci 1.32 to 3.17, z = 4.75 and i2 = 50%. Meta-analysis of measured symptoms and sensations during face mask use discomfort and face masks the results are summarized in figure 6a. Perceived discomfort was significantly higher in mask use during rest and activity in the pooled analysis. This could be found for general mask use (p < 0.001, smd = 1.16, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.73, z = 3.94, i2 = 74%), for n95 mask use (p < 0.001, smd = 1.98, 95% ci 1.37 to 2.59, z = 6.34, i2 = 0%) as well as for surgical mask use (p < 0.001, smd = 0.71, 95% ci 0.46 to 0.96, z = 5.58, i2 = 0%). Itch and face masks the results are summarized in figure 6b. In n95 mask use, the perceived itching was significantly elevated (p = 0.003, smd = 2.65, 95% ci 1.21 to 4.09, z = 3.6, i2 = 83%) during activity according to the pooled subgroup analysis. Exertion and face masks the results are summarized in figure 6c. Perceived exertion is significantly higher in mask use during activity in the pooled analysis. This could be found for general mask use (p < 0.001, smd = 0.90, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.23, z = 5.31. I2 = 71%), for n95 mask use (p = 0.002, sdm = 1.19, 95% ci 0.43 to 1.95, z = 3.06, i2 = 81%) as well as for surgical mask use (p < 0.001, smd = 0.63, 95% ci 0.40 to 0.87, z = 5.29, i2 = 24%). The eggers test indicates the presence of funnel plot asymmetry [t(df=10) = 2.68, p = 0.02]. For n95 mask use (p = 0.002, sdm = 1.19, z = 3.06, i2 = 81%) and this result was confirmed for surgical mask use too (p < 0.001, smd = 0.63, z = 5.29, i2 = 24%). There was no significant difference between the pooled effect sizes of n95 and surgical masks [q(df=1) = 1.97, p = 0.16]. Shortness of breath and face masks the results are summarized in figure 6d. Perceived shortness of breath was significantly higher during mask use during activity in the pooled analysis (p = 0.006, smd = 1.46, 95% ci 0.42 to 2.50, z = 2.75, i2 = 86%). Perceived heat and face masks the results are summarized in figure 6e. Perceived heat is significantly higher during mask use with physical activity in the pooled analysis (p = 0.002, smd = 0.70, 95%ci 0.28 to 1.13, z = 3.27, i2 = 62%). In the subgroup analysis containing surgical and n95 masks the heat perception was increased in both mask types, but only for the surgical mask condition a statistical significance for an increase in heat perception could be found (p = 0.008, sdm = 0.61, 95% ci 0.16 to 1.06, z = 2.66, i2 = 50%). Perceived humidity and face masks the results are summarized in figure 6f. Perceived humidity was significantly higher in mask use during activity according to the pooled analysis (p = 0.002, smd = 0.90, 95% ci 0.34 to 1.46, z = 3.17, i2 = 53%). The subgroup analysis containing surgical and n95 masks was completed merely for surgical masks due to lack of studies on n95 masks. In the surgical mask subgroup a statistical significance for an increase in humidity perception could be found (p < 0.001, smd = 0.63, 95% ci 0.36 to 0.90, z = 4.6, i2 = 0). Meta-analysis of n95 mask vs. Surgical mask the results are summarized in figures 7ac. The n95 mask leds to measurably worse effects compared to the surgical mask. The blood oxygenation was significantly decreased when using a n95 mask compared to a surgical mask with p = .003, smd = 0.53, 95% ci 0.88 to 0.18, z = 2.98, i2 = 37%. The heart rate (p = 0.01, smd = 0.25, 95% ci 0.05 to 0.45, z = 2.47, i2 = 0%), the perception of discomfort (p = 0.02, smd = 3.07, 95% ci 0.52 to 5.61, z = 2.36, i2 = 95%) and humidity (p = 0.02, smd = 0.59, 95% ci 0.09 to 1.10, z = 2.32, i2 = 0%) increased when the n95 mask was compared to the surgical mask. This trend was also evident for blood content of co2, minute volume, exertion, heat, shortened breath, and systolic blood pressure, but was not statistically significant due to the limited available studies. Meta-analysis with pooled prevalence of symptoms during face mask use the results are summarized in figure 8. Headache was the most frequent symptom among n = 2,525 subjects, with a prevalence of 62% for general mask use (p < 0.001, 95% ci 0.48 to 0.75), up to 70% with n95 masks (p < 0.001, 95% ci 0.52 to 0.88). Additionally, the prevalence of acne in n = 1,489 evaluated mask users was quite high, at 38% (p < 0.001, 95% ci 0.22 to 0.54), and skin irritation in n = 3,046 mask users had a similar prevalence of 36% (p < 0.001, 95% ci 0.24 to 0.49). Shortness of breath was highly prevalent in n = 2,134 general mask users, with 33% (p < 0.001, 95% ci 0.23 to 0.44), up to 37% for n95 (p = 0.01, 95% ci 0.07 to 0.67). Itching was also present in 26% of n = 5,000 subjects (p < 0.001, 95% ci 0.15 to 0.36), with a sharp difference between the 51% of n95 (p < 0.001, 95% ci 0.47 to 0.55) and the 17% of surgical masks (p < 0.001, 95% ci 0.09 to 0.26). These results were confirmed in control calculations using the r software. Furthermore, voice disorders, assessed in n = 1,097, were 23% prevalent (p = 0.03, 95% ci 0.02 to 0.43), although with high heterogeneity of the studies. Finally, dizziness had a prevalence of only 5% (p = 0.01, 95% ci 0.01 to 0.09), however it was investigated in only n = 153 subjects, therefore this finding requires further studies. Discussion besides possibly providing protection against the transmission of pathogens, face masks undoubtedly impede natural breathing. Such respiratory impairments due to the new-normal lifestyle under the present global pandemic have imposed potential adverse effects on our usual external (airways, lungs) and internal (cellular) respiration, affecting a wide range of physio-metabolic processes within various organ systems and/or at cellular levels (14, 26). Ensuing consequences were eventually observed at the physical, psychological and social levels along with certain clinical symptoms in the individual human beings (14). In this systemic review, we applied meta-analysis and comprehensive evaluations of physio-metabolic, physical, psychological and clinical burdens of wearing face masks in the general population. Restricting breathing through face masks has turned out to be a fundamental, incisive intervention with possible negative effects on public health. Physio-metabolic burden of masks our meta-analysis clearly depicts that masks, and especially the n95 masks, significantly restrict o2 uptake and hinder co2 release. Based on the meta-analytic effect sizes defined by cohen (102), the effect size for co2 retention (as per ptco2, etco2, and paco2 outcomes) is medium for all mask types and is larger for n95 masks. The effect size for o2 uptake disturbance (as per spo2 outcome) is relatively smaller but highly significant (p = 0.0004; figures 2a, b, 9a). Such respiratory gas-exchange discrepancy can be attributed to the constantly increased dead space ventilation volume (14, 60, 65, 103, 104) (i. E. , continuous rebreathing from the masks dead space volume) and breathing resistance (14, 53, 59, 66, 67, 83). Continuous co2 rebreathing causes the right-shift of hemoglobin-o2 saturation curve. Since o2 and co2 homeostasis influences diverse down-stream metabolic processes, corresponding changes toward clinically concerning directions may lead to unfavorable consequences such as transient hypoxemia and hypercarbia, increased breath humidity, and body temperature along with compromised physiological compensations etc. Transient hypoxemia a progressive decrease in spo2 is observed with respect to the duration of wearing a mask (26, 52, 56, 58, 72, 73, 81, 91, 105). The decline in spo2 levels confirmed in our systemic- review supports the onset and progression of oxidative stress (via significantly increased exhaled breath aldehydesoriginating from lipid peroxidation) reported by sukul et al. (26). Studies have shown that oxidative stress (under hypoxic conditions) can inhibit cell-mediated immune response (e. G. , t-lymphocytes, tcr cd4 complex, etc. ) to fight viral infections, which may gradually lead to immune suppression (106, 107). Arterial hypoxemia increases the level of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (hif-1), which further inhibits t-cells and stimulates regulatory t-cells (107). This may set the stage for contracting any infection, including sars-cov-2 and making the consequences of that infection much more severe. In essence, masks may put wearers at an increased risk of infection and severity (106108). A recent review (109) by serebrovska et al. Discusses a possible link between hif-1 activation and cell entry of sars-cov-2. If the cell is already under oxidative stress, activation of hif-1 may suppress important adaptive mechanisms e. G. , autophagy or proteasomal proteolysis is leads to the induction of necrosis and excessive cytokine production. Sturrock et al. (110) demonstrated that the sars-cov- 2 receptor (e. G. , ace2 and tmprss2) expression by primary type ii alveolar epithelial cells increased significantly following exposure to hypoxic environments in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, recent research has demonstrated that the cellular entry of sars-cov-2 also depends on many other receptor paths/routes (e. G. , cd147, cd147spike proteins etc. ), mediated by hif-1 upregulation (111114). Therefore, the effect of even mild hypoxemia for an extended span may promote an infection risk along with metabolic stress e. G. , due to altered ph via respiratory acidosis. In line with that, sukul et al. (26) observed a significant decrease in exhaled volatile metabolites (e. G. , organosulfur and short-chain fatty acids) originating from the lower gut microbiota during face mask useindicating anaerobiosis, metabolic acidosis and possible immunosuppression. Even marginal local effects of masks on salivary metabolites in young and healthy adults have indicated alteration of microbial metabolic activity (77). The findings of spira (16) from european data show that mask use correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, which could be due to the above-discussed possible processes. Moreover, prolonged hypoxic conditions and low oxygen levels pave the way for immunosuppression and inflammation, which may promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers (114116). However, further experimental studies are needed to prove that hypoxemia under long-term mask use may result in quantifiable changes in hif-1 and immunosuppressionespecially in older adults, ill/comorbid and/or immunocompromised individuals. Transient hypercarbia in line with the increased dead space ventilation and consistently decreasing spo2 level, co2 inhalation elevates progressively during the course of wearing a mask, causing transient hypercarbia (26, 52, 56, 58, 81, 91, 105). Very recent experimental data exist on co2 concentrations of concern in the air breathed while wearing masks, especially in children (117, 118). Systemic co2 concentration exerts an important influence on the intra- and extracellular ph. Co2 passes quickly through the cell membranes to form carbonic acid, which releases protons and in excess causes acidosis (119121). With a prolonged co2 burden the body uses the bones (co2 storage) to regulate the blood ph: bicarbonate and a positive ion (ca2+, k+, and na+) are exchanged for h+. Accordingly, kidney and organ calcification were frequently seen in animal studies on low-level co2 exposure (122, 123). Additionally, co2 in relationship with chronic and/or intermittent long-term exposure might induce pathological states by favoring dna alterations and inflammation (124, 125). Moreover, inflammation is reported to be caused by low-level co2 exposure in humans and animals (125 129). Even slightly elevated co2 induces higher levels of pro- inflammatory interleukin-1, a protein involved in regulating immune responses, which causes inflammation, vasoconstriction and vascular damage (128). In addition, carbon dioxide is also known as a trigger of oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ros) (124) including oxidative damage to cellular dna (124, 125). Altogether, the possible damaging mechanism of co2 affecting tissues is based on the conditions of oxidative stress and acidosis with increased inflammation and apoptosis as described above (124, 126131). In the long term, therefore, this could be possible during mask use even at blood-co2 levels that do not reach the thresholds. In spontaneously breathing subjects in a sitting position, exhaled co2 profiles mirror the endogenous isoprene exhalation (18, 132). Significant and progressively decreased breath isoprene recently observed in adults (26) indicates the deoxygenation driven sympathetic vasoconstriction in the peripheral compartments (133). Prolonged deoxygenation and co2 re-breathing therefore, may eventually lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction that may hinder blood-co2 levels to reach the thresholds. For instance, sukul et al. Also reported the presence of significant hyperventilation state in older adults aged 60 years before wearing a face mask for the participation in experiments. This indicates a compromised respiratory compensation of precedent mask use (which was obligatory due to pandemic regulations at that time) by these subjects. Physical burden of masks: humidity and skin temperature together with the immune-inhibiting mechanisms mentioned above, we found some other possible deleterious mask effects that impede healthy natural breathing. The most prominent and extreme effect was found in the increase of air humidity and skin temperature within the dead space of the mask (figures 5, 9b). Increased humidity and temperature can increase droplet and aerosol generation, which facilitate liquid penetration through the mask mesh. This not only increases the chance of microorganism (fungal and bacterial pathogens) growth on and in masks (134 136) causing increased risk for accumulation of fungal and bacterial pathogens (134, 136) including mucormycosis (137), but also leading to re-breathing of viruses that may be trapped and enriched within the moisturized mask meshwork. Therefore, these conditions within masks are favorable for pathogenic growth and are unfavorable for good/systemic microbiota i. E. , individual specific. As a result, the isolation of people with masks for extended periods can attain conditions for new and individual specific strains formations/mutations of pathogensto which other people in the environment will be susceptible and/or not immune. Additionally, the high concentration of microbiome in masks can be a potential source of infection for the population. The findings of fogen (11) using data from the usa which shows that mask use correlates with an increased mortality (case fatality rate of covid-19) could be due to these processes. This phenomenon could also explain the similar figures found by spira (16) in the eu. Compensatory physiological mechanisms our meta-analytically quantified co2-rise and o2-depletion (figures 2, 9a) with mask use certainly needs physiological compensations (figures 3, 4, 10). Interestingly, the compensatory responses to mask wearing (e. G. , rise in heart rate, changes in respiratory rate and/or minute ventilation etc. ) was lower (absent or even reverse) than expected (122, 138, 139). In former human experiments with low level 1-2% co2 exposure to breathing air which corresponds to measured values during mask use (140)an increased respiratory minute volume (ve) of >34% was detected (122). In contrast to that and according to our results under masks a significantly decreased ve by 19% on an average and up to 24% under n95 masks occurs despite face mask driven co2 exposure (140). Ve was even 10% lower for the n95 than for the surgical masks (figure 3a). However, it appears to have no acute clinical impact in the short term and does not exceed normal values of spo2 and systemic co2 although these may become problematic in the long run. A compensatory higher arterial paco2 and bicarbonate levels execute the buffering of inhaled co2. Interestingly, during chronic breathing of low co2 concentrations (in the no-mask condition), due to compensatory mechanisms, e. G. , lowered blood ph, increased respiratory rate and ve (122) and an acclimatization occurs (122, 138, 139, 141, 142). In mask users, those compensatory mechanisms however seem to differ or get disturbed (e. G. , no rise in respiratory rate, heart rate and simultaneous fall in ve). Health risks should be considered despite the mask related compensation attempts (140). During face mask use a rise in the arterial paco2 is possible in the long term (26, 52, 81, 91, 105). Although, paco2 generally remains at a sub-threshold level in healthy mask users (105, 138), concerning pathological changes can occur in older (>60 years) and sick people (26, 87). Our findings depicted an absence of typical compensatory reactions to transient hypercarbia thereby implying a suppression of a physiological response owing to the unusual conditions of wearing a mask. The reasons behind this phenomenon, i. E. , the absence of a rise in the respiratory rate and ventilation, remain unclear. The simultaneous change in the adverse direction (co2 rise and simultaneous o2 fall with concomitant dead space- and resistance enlargement caused by the mask) may be responsible for this. The drop in spo2 and the rise in co2 (ptco2, etco2, and paco2) with no major changes in the heart rate in our meta-analysis also transpires to be an unexpected reaction. Sukul et al. (26) reported altered breathing patterns, respiratory resistance and discomfort under medical masks. Adults younger than 60 years of age described slow breathing (slow and deep inspiration and expiration) under masks, whereas shallow/thoracic breathing (breathing with increased inhalation duration and effort), respiratory resistance and dyspnea was portrayed by those 60 years of age. Fittingly, altered breathing patterns/kinetics, progressive changes toward deoxygenation, hypercarbia and insignificant changes in the respiratory and heart rate transpired to be surprising mask outcomes in our present results (hypercapnia-like effects). Thus, prolonged masks use may lead to hypercapnic hypoxia like conditions. While short and acute hypercapnic hypoxia like conditions in healthy individuals can promote positive effects (sport, training, etc. ) (143145), a chronic/prolonged hypercapnic hypoxia (as also known from sleep apnea) is toxic for the renal (146), nervous (147), and cardiovascular system (148) in the long runcausing metabolic syndrome (14) as well as additional effects on cognitive functions (149). N95 mask compared to surgical mask in line with recent findings by kisielinski et al. (14) and sukul et al. (26), the present results clearly show that n95 masks lead to significantly more pronounced and unfavorable biochemical, physiological and psychological effects (figure 7) than surgical masks. Altogether, the results in blood oxygenation, discomfort, heart rate, co2, exertion, humidity, blood pressure, ve, temperature, dyspnea, and itching etc. Can be attributed to the larger (almost doubled) dead space and higher breathing resistance of the n95 mask (14). Compared to the surgical mask upon the short-term effects, n95 masks could impose elevated health risks under extended use. Interestingly, recent data from a large multi- country rct study show no significant differences between the two mask types in terms of sars-cov-2 infection rates (150). Nevertheless, there was long enforcement of n95 masks in e. G. , austria and germany (9). Short mask experiment times it is noteworthy to say that in studies with short assessment times neither correspond to real-life conditions nor do they exclude short- or long-term compensatory mechanisms, e. G. , obvious for co2-rebreathing. Short mask experiments are also unable to show long-term changes. However, immediate compensatory mechanisms can hide further adverse reactions (122, 138, 140). Therefore, longer observation times can lead to clearer values that are closer or above the thresholds due to the attenuation or collapse of transient physiological mechanisms. The experimental studies used here examined important outcomes only had a median examination time of 18 min (figure 11). Heterogeneous studies with small sample sizes yielded significant and medium to strong results (figures 10, 12). Nevertheless, experimental studies with longer assessment periods are needed. The observational studies included in the present analysis on symptoms were conducted over significantly longer periods (median 240 min, iqr 180) and are able to consider cumulative and long-term effects. It is known that observational studies are far more precise in finding negative effects and are particularly suitable to investigate exposures (e. G. , air pollution or smoking) that are difficult or impossible to investigate in randomized controlled trials (rcts). In addition, observational studies are important to investigate causes with a long latency period, such as toxicological and carcinogenic effects from environmental exposures or drugs (49). The longest period of included studies was 8 months with an averaged of wearing the mask 8 h per day (observational study), however with the shortest study with a 5 min examining/exposition time (controlled trial). Possible sub-threshold impact of masksthe low-dose long-term effect on health in contrast to our study, most of the recent systematic reviews (2731) have only analyzed a few outcome threshold values without considering comprehensive effects, exposure time and the susceptibility of the exposed organisms and tissues. Therefore, their recommendations e. G. , masks are harmless and safe for everybody etc. Appears to be superficial, non-medical, non-holistic, and misleading. In accordance with conclusions of sukul et al. , fikenzer et al. , and zhang et al. (26, 53, 62), we have found hints to deleterious effects even without exceeding physiological threshold values and we have interpreted these data as a risk for individuals with suppressed compensatory mechanisms such as in older individuals and sick subjects with cardiorespiratory diseases, infection, diabetes, cancer, and other comorbidities. Sukul et al. (26) were able to show that the unfavorable effects are more pronounced in the older adults (aged: 6080 years). Moreover, they could provide evidence for toxic effects of face masks including oxidative stress, immunosuppression, deoxygenation and hypercarbia induced vasoconstriction and altered systemic microbial activity. Even with co2 and spo2 levels that do not exceed the limits, many clinical researchers have also found troubling results in face mask wearers. Neurologists observed changes in mri brain signal baseline level due to face mask use (15). Wearing a surgical mask for merely 9 min increased end-tidal co2 causing mild hypercapnia. This was responsible for a compensatory increase in cerebral blood flow with morphological changes similar to that of a co2 gas challenge or holding your breath. In patients with aneurysms or brain tumors this phenomenon could be deleterious. Another study showed a pathologic and altered brain metabolism while wearing a n95 mask for 6 h (17). The mri imaging revealed a significant drop in brain oxygenation. A more than 50% drop in oxygenation in the cingulate gyrus (cognition circuit) after 6 h of mask use was associated with clinical symptoms of a confused state in 80% of the subjects above 35 years. The authors even concluded that the general population should not wear a n95 mask. This phenomenon of brain deoxygenation could be dangerous for people with altered brain functions when on medication, after a transient ischemic attack (tia) or stroke, respectively. Ophthalmological studies indicated risk of retinal damage from long-term use of masks. N95 masks reduced the vascular density in the vascular plexus even under resting conditions as early as after 60 min (151). Here, the drop in spo2 and increase in blood pressure were significant but within the normal physiological range. Another study reported a significant mask-induced increase in intraocular pressure (iop) after 5 min of wearing (12). Thus, wearing masks may counteract the therapy aiming to reduce the iop and can exacerbate irreversible long-term vision problems in individuals with glaucoma. Numerous other studies have shown that the long- term effects, leading to deleterious clinical outcome may result from prolonged mask wearing (15, 17, 151, 152). Such effects are comparable to sick building syndrome (sbs) (153), cigarette smoking and other chronic, slightly toxic influences relevant to the general population. In accordance with our present analysis and precedent scoping review (14), mask-related changes in leaning toward pathological values can lead to illness and clinical consequences, just like chronically, repeated subliminal harmful environmental events. Occupational diseases defined by the international labor organization (ilo) and that are in accordance with the workers compensation act in germany illustrates the potential harm caused by chronic exposure to subthreshold environmental factors (154). Numerous examples of these principles can be found in the literature concerning pharmacology, toxicology, clinical and occupational medicine and even in psychology (155164). Many other toxicological and environmental health examples are presented in the recent scoping review by kisielinski et al. (14), which refers to mies (mask-induced exhaustion syndrome). Such subliminal chronical changes and harmful effects in the long run are comparable to the sick building syndrome (sbs) (153), cigarette smoking (165), salty diet (166), aluminum environmental pollution (167), low-level lead exposure (168), organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyl exposure (169), or even the so-called climate change exposure (170). Altogether, even the subliminal changes due to face mask use can become clinically relevant. Overlapping of face mask effects (mies) with long-covid-19 symptoms regarding the numerous mask symptoms an important question arises: can masks be responsible for a misinterpreted long-covid-19-syndrome after an effectively treated covid-19 infection? Nearly 40% of main long-covid-19 symptoms (171) overlap with mask related complaints and symptoms described by kisielinski et al. As mies (14) like fatigue, dyspnea, confusion, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dizziness, and headache, which we also detected in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of face mask effects in our systematic review. It is possible that some symptoms attributed to long-covid-19 are predominantly mask-related. Further research on this phenomenon needs to be conducted. Complaints and symptoms under mask use and the who definition of health amongst the perceived sensations with mask use only six symptoms (exertion, discomfort, shortness of breath, humidity, heat, and itch) could be meta-analyzed and have resulted in predominantly strong effect sizes (figure 12). In the pooled prevalence analysis, we included eight main symptoms namely headache, acne, skin irritation, shortness of breath, heat, itch, voice disorder, and dizziness (figure 13) out of which all were significant in the evaluated population (figure 8). There are many more reported in the literature. However, these could not be meta-analyzed due to the low number of comparable studies on those particular complaints. In the included literature additional reported mask related symptoms were: rhinitis (80), difficulties to think and to concentrate (81, 94, 95, 101), drowsiness (95), communication disorder (88, 94, 99), depression and mood swings (75, 76, 88, 92), anger (92), perceived discomfort (47, 52, 53, 69), anxiety (75, 88, 92), and an overall perceived fatigue and exhaustion (5254, 5762, 68, 70, 71, 73, 79, 83, 94). All of these mask-related symptoms contradict a state of wellbeing and health as defined by the who. According to the who; health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (172). Based on our findings, the use of face mask in the hope of maintaining health is unfortunately contradicting the whos definition of health. Regarding all the possible side effects of mask and their still unproven efficacy against viral transmission within the general population (5, 10, 173, 174), health seems not to be substantially preserved by wearing face masks. So far, only two randomized controlled mask trials for prevention of sars-cov-2 infection in the general population have been published: one high quality study from denmark, europe (175), and the other from bangladesh with biased results and a lot of inconsistencies (176). Based on a bayesian random-effects meta-analysis of these two trials, the posterior median for relative risk was 0.91 (95% credible interval 0.631.33, 73% probability of some benefits with very limited evidence) (177). Recent data from a large multi-country rct study show no significant differences between the surgical and n95 mask in terms of sars-cov-2 infection rates (150). Asides, there is evidence that covid-19 rates have been able to expand swiftly when omicron hit (178) even in societies where mask use was assiduously followedas in korea, taiwan, hong kong, and singapore (179). The paucity in high-quality mask studies is unfortunate. Seeing the overall weak evidence for efficacy of masks against viral transmission within the general population (5, 10, 173, 174, 180184), face masks have to be evaluated appropriately in the sense of the hippocratic oath and as per the primum nihil nocere (above all do not harm). To avoid at all costs that the damage caused by preventive or therapeutic measures becomes greater than that caused by the disease itself, should be the credo of all those involved in the containment of the crisis, including politicians and the so-called experts. Medical decisions can only be made on the basis of comprehensive knowledge on a patients overall condition, individualized case history, considering all previous illnesses and interventions, physical and mental predispositions, and his/her socio-economic state, etc. When it comes to medical decision- making in a sick person, the weighing of therapeutic measures for the benefit of the patient against the side effects of the therapy is to be evaluated differently than a prophylactic procedure in healthy people. If wrong decisions are made in the selection of preventive measures in healthy individuals, or if they are improperly applied, the consequences are usually much more severe and liability claims are often unavoidable. From a standardization point of view the filtration efficacy of mask for viruses remains hypothetic and not in line with the established standards. There are national and international standards for bacteria filtration efficiency (bfe) for medical masks since decades, for example the eu-en 14683, or the usa-astm f2101. They are the prerequisites for general approval. However, since 2020 (i. E. , nearly 3 years), no comparable standard/testing of masks for viruses does yet exist. Given the fact, that medical masks (surgical and n95) increase particle exhalation in the smallest size range of 0.30.5 m, shifting the geometric mean diameter toward smaller sizes (longer in air) compared to no mask conditions (185) doubts arise. Such scientific facts are pointing toward the nebulization effect of masks, which could be an add-on for their weakness against viral transmission in general. Limitations our systematic review rarely discussed the inhaled toxins associated with the mask. Inhalation and ingestion of toxic substances, which are ingredients of the masks, are also of importance in evaluating this pandemic non-pharmaceutical intervention (npi). In addition, our work has not extensively studied the microbial colonization of masks and the consequences of contamination by microorganisms for the wearer. In our meta-analysis etco2 and ptco2 have been used as an approximation of paco2 (4446). Therefore, the real paco2 values could be slightly higher or lower. The median exposure period for most studies evaluating physio-metabolic mask adverse effects was 18 min. There are few experimental studies evaluating mask adverse effects for longer periods that would more closely reflect real-world use. Therefore, the negative physio-metabolic and clinical effects of the face masks may well be worse than we have determined. Based on the studies conducted during the pandemic, the control groups without masks were mostly the same individuals, or individuals who were not mask abstinent for too long (general mask requirement) (186), so the mask-no-mask differences may be mitigated. Because of the rapid flow of science, new relevant papers have certainly appeared that we were unable to consider in the meta-analysis as they appeared after the period of our data search (search limitation to 31.12.2021). The most important and relevant observational studies were considered for this analysis thereby addressing the physio-metabolic and clinical effects. Numerous psychological and social effects could not be assessed analytically as too few relevant and evaluable studies were available. However, the simplest and clearest face mask harms, over and above the physiological and clinical discussed here, are the psychological and social onesimpeding communication visually and verbally (187189), disturbed facial expressions and misinterpretation of emotions (190), with the consequence of impeded early childhood learning (191).
