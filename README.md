ðŸª» A small demonstration app that allows you to enter a text (we're thinking of biomedical texts here), and ask ChatGPT to (a) summarise and (b) simplify it. 

ðŸ‘§ You can chose from different personas, and thus regulate the level of simplification.

# Usage

* it's a `streamlit` app, under `poetry` dependency management, so use the following command to run:

```
poetry run streamlit run app.py
```

# Development

* I like to use `poetry`, but I always forget that `streamlit` doesn't, so I need to add the packages to the `requirements.txt` and then [reboot](https://share.streamlit.io/) the app.

# Wish List

- [ ] Refactoring for the main generation
- [ ] Test cases, pre-commits etc.
    - [ ] Try out `mypy`
- [ ] Tidy out `helpers` package
