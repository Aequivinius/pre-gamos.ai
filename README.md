ðŸª» A small demonstration app that allows you to enter a text (we're thinking of biomedical texts here), and ask ChatGPT to (a) summarise and (b) simplify it. 

ðŸ‘§ You can chose from different personas, and so regulate the level of simplification.

# Usage

* it's a `streamlit` app, under `poetry` dependency management, so use the following command to run:

```
poetry run streamlit run app.py
```

# Development

* I like to use `poetry`, but I always forget that `streamlit` doesn't, so I need to remember to `poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt` before `push`ing
